## This is a very visual plugin on Rōblox made by Respected Leader VisualPlugin.
(Oh, great people of Rōblox, we are on the verge of a turning point that will forever revolutionise the way you build as you know it.  Gone are the abject struggles of false utilitarian dreams.  Gone are the worthless and illogical routines that ossify in our malleable brains.  What we need is a plugin equipped for the limelight; a plugin that towers above the rest and masters itself in accolades.  To complement the greatness of this work of elloquence, the most august names shall be included in a product to this magnitude.) [https://youtu.be/C9CkVAKL778]

For this, we introduce **Respected Leader VisualPlugin**.

***

**To try the plugin out, you first need to have [Accessible Plugins](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/accessible-plugins-per-place-game-editable-executable-straight-from-the-explorer/215672) installed on Studio.**  Once done, download [`RLVP.rbxlx`](https://github.com/Windows81/The-Fruitful-Labours-of-the-Visual-Roblox-Plugin-of-Respected-Leader-VisualPlugin-the-Prolific/raw/master/RLVP.rbxlx) and open it.  You then can choose one of two ways to complete the procedure:
1. Expand `TestService` in your *explorer* widget.  Then manually drag the script into `LocalPlugins`.  The plugin will automatically appear on your *plugins* ribbon tab.
2. Press the *run* button (not *play*) in Studio and execute the following code in the command line.  The plugin will then appear on your *plugins* ribbon tab.
```lua
game.TestService:FindFirstChildWhichIsA'LuaSourceContainer'.Parent=game.TestService.LocalPlugins
```
